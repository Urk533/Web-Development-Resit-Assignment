			<h1 class = "site-hone1">My Module Experience</h1>
			<p class = "site-par1">My module experience is a bit different from others because I am a module repeat student. I had already given my web assignment a year ago with my batch but unfortunately I failed in term-2 of assignment due to which I had to repeat my module. So all the required materials for studying purpose and assignment was already provided to me by lecturer and university. This year with junior batch it was not any thing new for me. Until this year I had learned so many modules containing programming languages. Because of this web development-1 has been really easy for me in comparison to last year. Last year this software engineering field was completely new to me due to which I had problem learning web developent module. Due to which my assignment was not that good and I was just passed in term one of assignment last year of this module. This time I got alot of experience in programming and coding so I think I can do much better in assignment than last time. Talking about my preparation for this year assignment, I had to say it was really hard to me. Because it was a year gap so I had forgotten so many things regarding this module. And also I have to prepare for my other modules TCA's of this year so it was really hard to give time for all the modules. But I some how managed to recap last years topics form lecture slides and other internet sources. I also contacted with my module leader regarding this assignment and module. And now I am in completing stage of my assignment and I will see how this will end.</p>

			<h1 class = "site-hone2">My Webpage Development Method</h1>
			<p class = "site-par2">Every one have their own way of coding for webpages so I think mine is also different than others. I used to code for web page in sublime text editor. During coding I used to put alot of comments so that I did not have to be confused after seeing my code after long period. And it is very useful idea which I think every one should follow. Also I used to learn coding through different sources from internet like websites, youtube etc. due to which I would get more clarity in the coding. There used to be tutorials of every topic of this module which we have to complete in the tutorial class. And I used to complete all the tutorials of respective topics and also I used to practice extra from the internet. I can design different webages having varities of layouts using HTML and CSS. But I have still not mastered all the things of web development. There are some methods with which I am not good at. I am still practicing to be master at web designing. Now talking about the web pages that I built during the process of assignment is there was given four web pages to make besides this one. And those four web pages are as follows:</p>
			<ol class = "site-ol1">
				<li class = "site-li2">Home Page</li>
				<li class = "site-li2">Portfolio Page</li>
				<li class = "site-li2">Contact Page</li>
				<li class = "site-li2">Blog Page</li>
			</ol>
