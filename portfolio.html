	    			<p class = "port-pa">I started programming when I was in 12th grade beacause I choosed computer instead of math. And since then I have learned so many thing about computers and programming languages through course book and also through internet. The first programming language I learned was C. It was very difficult for me to learn at first but slowly I became pretty good at it. Before joining software enginerring I already had learned web development, database and C programming. Because of that it became really very easy for me to start my software engineering journey in NAMI college.</p>

	    			<p class = "port-pc">I learned video editing after I passed my 12th class. As I lost a year after college so I had enough time to learn new skills. I learned it from a youtube channel and it helped me alot. After then I have edited so many personal videos for my own purpose and my also my family. It has become so useful for me. I also used to edit videos for my friend for his youtube channel. Now a days also I am learning new skills on video editing and hopefully I can become a very good video editor in coming future.</p>

I also has a gaming channel on youtube which is at starting level. I use my video editing skill here to upload gaming videos in youtube videos. The game that I play is FIFA which is about football and I have been really playing this games since my childhood. There is very few competition on our country on football gaming channel as there are very few people who are creating this. So hopefully I can become a very good gamer and I could grow my youtube channel.</p>
